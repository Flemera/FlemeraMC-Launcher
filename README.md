<h1 align="center">FlemeraMC Launcher</h1>

FlemeraMC Launcher is the custom launcher for **Flemera’s modded Minecraft servers**.  
It automatically installs the correct Minecraft version, modpacks, configurations, and Java if needed — allowing players to join with **a single click**.

No manual setup, no mod troubleshooting, no mismatch errors — the launcher handles everything.
